I just thought that I'd make something a little more interesting than 'Hello World!'. So the goal here is to write a chess game where you can play against the computer and hopefully lose from first principals. I realize there's lots of libraries out there already to do this, but as a learning exercise, I'll try to do this from scratch. Eventually, once the model and game are up and running, port it to Android so I can play on my phone against anyone locally through Bluetooth, because I think it would be nice to have a chess board that can be played from different tents camping with no reception. And I think it would be amusing to be able to write something that can beat me in chess from first principles (I am by no means an expert player or even a competitive player, just a recreational one).<br>\n<br>\nIf you've never encountered this format before, it's a Jupyter Notebook, which runs Python. It's a sequence of markdown and code cells. The code all shares a common execution environment like you would expect from Python, but you can go and rerun cells in whatever order you like. Click on Edit to open a runnable window and Run All if you want to run everything sequentially.<br>\n<br>\nSo let's break that down a bit better:<br>\n<br>\n1. Write a basic chess game - DONE<br>\n2. Build the datasets/features - IN PROGRESS<br>\n3. Build and train the models<br>\n4. Plug it all together<br>\n5. Play chess<br>\n6. Refactor and polish - IN PROGRESS<br>\n7. Port to Android<br>\n<br>\nCurrent progress:<br>\nIt could use more tests, but otherwise the game appears to be working. I'll do better test coverage when I rewrite it, because this is a prototype, not something I'm happy with (see Part 6 for more details). The UI sucks in that it simply prints a new board and you have to type your moves in manually, no mouse clicking because Kaggle has issues with interactivity. But, as there's still plenty of other things in here to look at, I'll solve having an interactive board another day, or maybe I won't and just have the log history of the game and put that in the Android version. So for now, it just prints a new board after every move and you have to type your move.<br>\n<br>\nNext up is to turn the data into something we can do something with, namely some numpy arrays of shape (num_turns, rows, columns) with labels of who won. I'll try to engineer some features from there and see where I get. To get the arrays, I'm going to replay a bunch of other peoples' games and grab the arrays at the end and label them accordingly. Fortunately, chess is one of those games where data is available freely, in abundance, and of pretty high quality. There's absolutely no shortage of online repositories of chess games, and the one I'll be using is Lichess.org's open database. And once we look at the data, we find that there's multiple formats available, any of which can be used, but all require parsers, with some being simpler to write than others. In particular, Universal Chess Interface (UCI) is the one with the easiest parsing in my opinion, so that's the one I'm going to start with.<br>\n<br>\nUpdate: I've decided that the original code is so bad that I'm going to rewrite it and include the parser at that point. This is partly due to how slow it would be, since ideally we'd be loading millions of games. This could be done without error checking and much faster, but that just sounds like a good way to get bad data fast, so I'll test my code and convert the games to numpy arrays at the same time.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n**Note: If you would just like to play the game yourself, first select 'Edit' and then click 'Run All', and then navigate down to Part 3 (the Table of Contents works in Edit mode) and uncomment the line indicated and run that cell again.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Part 2 - The Code</h1><br>\nMy imports and global variables.

As for what makes a game desirable, first we need to be able to label it accurately. White wins, black wins or stalemate are the only ones we're interested in, ongoing games don't give us any useful information. Next we should probably decide on a skill level to train on. At first glance, the best ranked players may be the obvious choice, but I'm less interested in them. I want the other games too, the ones where people make stupid moves and we see what happens when people make stupid moves. We probably also want the better players, but we may want to balance the ratios better. Training against games where one player is noticably stronger than the other also has some interesting potential.<br>\n<br>\nOnce we have the games converted into numpy arrays, it will be time for feature engineering. My general idea was to train some models on lots of curated played games and build a classifier model that will predict the likelihood of each player winning based on a given board and then just picking the move whose board has the highest chance of winning. No need to teach the AI anything about the rules of chess, we'll just be running a prediction based on a numpy array representing a board and some whatever features I manage to pull out and picking the one with the best odds. I may have to train a white model and a black model and mash them together into the final product, but that's not the end of the world.<br>\n<br>\nI'll come back to this section when I get a bit further on the refactoring.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Part 6 - The Refactoring</h1><br>\nSo now that I have a much better idea of what it needs to do and what it needs to be able to load, time to refactor it. \nSo this needs to be rewritten now that I think I know what it needs to do beyond just be a chessboard.
